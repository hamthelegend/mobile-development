# Mobile Development

This GitHub repository is free for all, so share away❣️

## Kotlin Basics

You can find the Kotlin basics tutorial under the package `basics`.

## Kotlin Challenges

You can find the Kotlin challenges under the package `challenges`.

There are two solutions here to every challenge, the over-engineered one
and the simplified one. If you still need help with either version,
feel free to contact me.

I did not make any of the challenges, all the credit goes to Sir Japhet.
I'm only sharing my solution.
